# Cardboard20 - A Low Cost DIY Project For Beginners!

The mechanical keyboard community loves doing DIY projects, i.e. keyboard builds, but said builds are often quite expensive costing anywhere from $50-$10,000. 

These keyboards often prioritize form over function, as personalization is a large component of the appeal. Our project will prioritize function over form with the appeal coming from a strikingly low cost. 

The Cardboard20 is inspired by products such as nintendo labo, or google cardboard, being a single sheet of cardboard cut to take the shape similar to a number pad when folded, with a 5x4 matrix. This keyboard will be hand wired and soldered to a microcontroller that the end user will program themselves. This aligns with the DIY nature that draws the attention of the mechanical keyboard community. 

The design philosophy is to minimize cost as much as possible, to make the build as accesible as possible to hobbyists. 

## Project Design
1. The material used is cardboard, and the entire product will be made out of a single sheet
2. This means that the mounting plate is also the chassis
3. Instead of providing a PCB, the user is responsible for wiring the matrix and programming the microcontroller
4. If the 5x4 layout is cost prohibitive, we can use other dimensions
5. ALPS plate will come in the future

## Parts/Materials List for Build
1. Cardboard20 Chassis/Plate
2. Electrical Wire + Solder
3. Microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico Reccomended)
4. Keycaps
